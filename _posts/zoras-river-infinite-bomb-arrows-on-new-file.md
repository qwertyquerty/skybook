## Summary

After setting up [Infinite Bomb Arrows](/posts/infinite-bomb-arrows), you can route through [Back in Time](/posts/back-in-time) so a new file starts with functional bombs/arrows access far earlier than intended.

## Requirements

- A completed Infinite Bomb Arrows setup.
- A valid [Back in Time Save](/posts/back-in-time-save) flow.
- For bomb transfer consistency, this works best when all three bomb bags are owned and filled with the same bomb type.

## Transfer Flow

1. Perform [Infinite Bomb Arrows](/posts/infinite-bomb-arrows).
2. Perform [Back in Time](/posts/back-in-time).
3. On Eldin Bridge title-screen state, die twice and choose `Retry` on Game Over.
4. You load into King Bulblin with bow access and ammo state carried over.
5. Save/quit to continue on the BiT-derived file while keeping the transferred resource state.

## Setup Path Commonly Used

- The Iza-side setup typically comes from [Steal Lent Bomb Bag / Black Rupee](/posts/zoras-river-steal-lent-bomb-bag-black-rupee), including the Wii-only Iza 1 escape variant.
