## Summary

This route family reaches Snowpeak and Snowpeak Ruins before intended progression by combining [Map Glitch](/posts/map-glitch-warp-method), [Long Jump Attack (LJA)](/posts/long-jump-attack-lja), [Wolf Link Super Jump](/posts/wolf-link-super-jump), and dive-based movement setups.

## Early Snowpeak

After Lanayru Twilight, the ice door into Peak Province is gone, but climbing Snowpeak normally without Reekfish Scent still causes a void-out. The source page documents two ways around this:

1. `Map Glitch` method:
   Use [Map Glitch](/posts/map-glitch-warp-method) when entering Peak Province from Zora's Domain to suppress the snowstorm void behavior. Remove Map Glitch before digging in the cave to avoid a softlock.
2. `Super Jump` method:
   Use a precise [Wolf Link Super Jump](/posts/wolf-link-super-jump) off a Wolfos to reach upper terrain and bypass the void trigger.

## Earlier Snowpeak

This variant reaches Snowpeak after Eldin Twilight (meteor warp available) but before starting Lanayru Twilight.

### `LJA` method:
Set up [Map Glitch](/posts/map-glitch-warp-method) in outer Zora's Domain, reach out-of-bounds ledges, [LJA](/posts/long-jump-attack-lja) into invisible water, then clip back in bounds beyond the ice wall and savewarp into the tunnel.

### `Rupee Dive` method:
Use a rupee dive setup (see [Rupee / Cutscene / Midna Dive](/posts/rupee-cutscene-midna-dive)) with Fixed EMS/Barnes bomb bag state to swim behind the ice wall and re-enter bounds near the Snowpeak exit.

## Earliest Snowpeak

The earliest documented setup reaches Snowpeak before melting Zora's Domain ice, combining [Map Glitch](/posts/map-glitch-warp-method), boomerang-keese movement, [Wolf Link Super Jump](/posts/wolf-link-super-jump), and [LJA](/posts/long-jump-attack-lja) to route into the Snowpeak tunnel and then savewarp in.
