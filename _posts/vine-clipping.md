## Summary

Vine Clipping is a collision trick that gets Link through vine walls. The standard method uses a bomb damage boost; Wii also has a [Clawshot L-Slide](/posts/clawshot-l-slide)-style angle option that can clip vines with Clawshot alone.

## Bomb Method (All Versions)

1. Approach a vine wall and climb it.
2. Drop from the vines, face away from the wall, and place a bomb.
3. Turn back quickly and grab the vines.
4. After the fifth bomb flash, hold left or right and climb twice.
5. If timed correctly, Link clips through the vines.

## Clawshot Method (Wii Only)

1. On Wii, use Clawshot from an angle that takes advantage of wider practical aim angles.
2. Fire/position to force Link through the vine collision without bomb damage.

## Notes

- This is a straightforward setup trick once bomb flash timing is learned.
- The Clawshot-only variant is platform-dependent and is documented as Wii-only.
