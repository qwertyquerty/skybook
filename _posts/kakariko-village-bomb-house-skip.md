## Summary

Bomb House Skip despawns the normal bomb house event by delaying the trigger and killing a basement bug before the event state fully resolves.

## Setup and Execution

1. Enter Kakariko bomb house sequence in wolf.
2. Position for the cutscene-delay setup and collect/kill the basement bug early (related consistency work: [Kakariko Village - Basement Bug Manip](/posts/kakariko-village-basement-bug-manip)).
3. Keep movement and camera stable during the trigger handoff to avoid re-activating the normal sequence.
4. If done correctly, bomb house progression is skipped/despawned.
