## Summary

Pickup Slide is a movement/collision state where Link slowly drifts during an item-get text/cutscene pose, often ignoring normal wall collision while still following ground checks. It is extremely slow, so most uses are niche or category-specific.

## How To

1. Trigger an item-get state where Link turns and holds an item toward the camera.
2. Common triggers include rupees, boomerang-collected pickups, and chest item text.
3. If the setup is favorable, Link starts drifting in a fixed direction while item text remains active.
4. Keep text open while drifting; closing text ends the slide.

## Notes

- The source page documents that slide speed and direction are not fully understood and can vary by setup/area.
- Practical use is limited by speed; some gates/walls can require multi-hour clips.
- Known use-cases include Low% gate clips and slow wall bypasses such as Sacred Grove and Arbiter's Grounds setups.
