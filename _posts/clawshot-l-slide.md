## Summary

Clawshot L-Slide is a movement technique where two quick `L` presses during a clawshot aim sequence preserve movement while Clawshot is out. It is primarily used as a movement option in areas where Clawshot-ready movement lines up with route needs.

## Setup

1. Stand in a place where Clawshot movement has a route purpose (for example, Lakebed clips or Cave of Ordeals movement).
2. Hold Clawshot to enter aiming state.
3. Be ready to input quick `L` taps with tight timing.

## Execution

1. Press `L`.
2. Immediately release and press `L` again.
3. If timed correctly, Link can keep moving with Clawshot out instead of locking into normal stationary aim behavior.

## Uses

- Lakebed movement and clip setups where preserving speed while Clawshot is active is valuable.
- Cave of Ordeals movement lines where Clawshot handling otherwise slows setup.

## Notes

- The source page documents this as a technical movement option with situational use, not a universal time save in every route.
- Closely related technique: [Clawshot Actor Displacement](/posts/clawshot-actor-displacement).
- Other commonly paired movement tools: [Long Jump Attack (LJA)](/posts/long-jump-attack-lja) and [Step Clip](/posts/step-clip).
