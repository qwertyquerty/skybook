## Summary

Dash Cancel lets Wolf Link reset dash cooldown by interrupting the dash very early, roughly within the first 10 frames. This allows immediate re-dashes in places where a normal interrupted dash would force cooldown downtime.

## How To

1. Start a Wolf Link dash with `A`.
2. Cancel the dash quickly with one of the two practical methods:
3. `B-Attack Dash Cancel`: press `B` right after dash start to interrupt with a bite animation.
4. `Ledge Dash Cancel`: start dash right before stepping off a ledge so the ledge transition cancels the dash.

## Common Uses

- Castle Town movement chains, where repeated early cancels are often faster than waiting on normal dash cooldown.
- Ledge-heavy movement sections like Castle Sewers and Eldin Twilight, where ledge transitions naturally support dash cancels.

## Notes

- The source page also notes canceling by bonk, stumble, or taking damage, but those are generally not useful for speed strats.
- Water-to-land transitions can also produce useful cancels when timed at the edge.
