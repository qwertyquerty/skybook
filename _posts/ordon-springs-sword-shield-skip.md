## Summary

Sword & Shield Skip bypasses the expected Ordon Sword, Ordon Shield, and Ordon Spring portal collection by positioning Hugo (bulblin) near the twilight barrier and chaining [Long Jump Attack (LJA)](/posts/long-jump-attack-lja) over Midna's text trigger.

On some [Back in Time Save](/posts/back-in-time-save) routes, this is route-critical because normal sword/shield collection can become unavailable.

## Setup and Execution

1. Lure Hugo toward the Faron twilight barrier wall (Ordon Spring side).
2. Target Hugo and push him forward until Link is just before Midna's forced-send-back trigger.
3. Nudge Hugo slightly away from the wall so Link faces the barrier center while still targeting.
4. Wait for Hugo's attack, then do backhop -> jump attack.
5. While Hugo is still airborne, jump attack again for the extending LJA over the trigger.

If Hugo takes damage during attempts, reload immediately. After enough hits, Hugo dies and the setup is no longer retryable from current state.

## Visual Cues

Common alignment cues are a black ground line and white ground splotch.

## Method Variants

- `Slide method`: delay second jump attack slightly when Hugo is farther from trigger.
- `No-slide (stick)`: hold back through first landing to avoid slide before second jump attack.
- `No-slide (mash)`: can work in specific first-hit spacings but is less generally consistent.
