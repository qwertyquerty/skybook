## Summary

Early City in the Sky gets Link to cannon-room progression before the intended setup flow. Common variants are a transform/collision method, a no-map-warping state-preservation method, and an [Long Jump Attack (LJA)](/posts/long-jump-attack-lja) method.

## Transform Method

In wolf, position against sanctuary statue collision and use the transform interaction to clip through and reach the intended "broken cannon" route area early.

## No Map Warping Method

After Temple of Time, preserve cannon-room state with a savewarp/deathwarp sequence so Shad returns Link while the normal cannon warp restriction trigger is not active. This is closely related to [Kakariko Sanctuary - Cannon Room Save Glitch](/posts/kakariko-sanctuary-cannon-room-save-glitch), and is often discussed alongside [Map Glitch (Warp Method)](/posts/map-glitch-warp-method) routes.

## Long Jump Attack Method

Use statue positioning plus [Long Jump Attack (LJA)](/posts/long-jump-attack-lja) to pass the collision line and open early City in the Sky access.
