## Transform Method

A statue clip setup gives early access to the broken cannon path, enabling an early City in the Sky route and skipping major intended progression.

## No Map Warping Method

After Temple of Time, a savewarp or deathwarp out of cannon room can preserve state so Shad returns Link while disabling the normal cannon warp restriction trigger.

## Long Jump Attack Method

A Long Jump Attack (TODO: Citation) line through statue collision bypasses intended setup and opens an early route to City in the Sky.
