## Summary

Steal Lent Bomb Bag keeps Iza's temporary bomb bag after agreeing to her minigame, giving early bombs and routes into bomb-dependent skips. Documented setups include a Wolf Link escape, map-based methods, and a second-bag "black rupee" duplication variant.

## Requirements

- Lanayru Twilight completed and Iza's hut accessible.
- Open portal at Upper Zora's River.
- A setup method:
  - Wolf method: transformation access.
  - Ooccoo method: [Early Lakebed Temple - Various Methods](/posts/lake-hylia-early-lakebed-temple-various-methods) or any dungeon Ooccoo state.
  - Map methods: [Universal Map Delay (UMD)](/posts/universal-map-delay-umd) execution.

## Method Context

The source page combines several ways to exit with the lent bag.

1. Wolf setup: force wolf state before agreeing to help Iza, clear shadow messengers, accept the minigame, then warp away after the wheel appears.
2. Ooccoo setup: accept Iza's bag, then use Ooccoo Jr. to return into a dungeon; bag stays in inventory.
3. Map methods: use map-open timing (including UMD variants) to warp out during Iza flow.
4. Wii bow variant: start Iza 1 and talk to Iza during the bomb-arrow rock cutscene timing to keep the lent bag.

## Black Rupee / Second Bag Variant

The source page also describes a duplication sequence:

1. After stealing the first lent bag, warp back to Upper Zora's River.
2. Re-enter Iza flow and agree again.
3. Wheel shows an empty bag slot with a black rupee icon.
4. Closing wheel and leaving keeps a second bag slot that persists.

The second slot stays, but after a save prompt its bomb contents revert to what the first lent bag had when duplication occurred (30 normal bombs by default).

## Practical Uses

- Enables [Normal Bombs Underwater](/posts/normal-bombs-underwater) setups once bombs are available in water routes.
- Supports [Infinite Bomb Arrows](/posts/infinite-bomb-arrows) and related Iza routing.
- Interacts with [Back in Time - Save Corruption](/posts/back-in-time-save) inventory loading paths.
