## Summary

Cutscene Diving lets Link reach the bottom of water without Zora Armor by falling from a ledge while a text/cutscene state is active.

This was historically used for [Lake Hylia - Early Lakebed Temple (Various Methods)](/posts/lake-hylia-early-lakebed-temple-various-methods), but is mostly obsolete now because easier entries exist.

## Methods

### Item-Push Dive (Wii)

Often called Midna Dive when Midna text is used.

1. Pick up an overhead object (commonly a box).
2. Stand close to a ledge over water.
3. Trigger a short text/cutscene state while still holding the object, usually by:
   - talking to Midna, or
   - using a bottle with contents.
4. If positioned correctly, Link drops the held object, gets pushed off the ledge, and falls while text is active.

### NPC Text Push Dive (GameCube Alternative)

1. Pick up an overhead object.
2. Stand in front of an NPC with a ledge immediately behind Link.
3. Talk to the NPC so Link drops the object and gets pushed off the ledge during textbox state.

This setup is location-limited, so it is uncommon in runs.

### Rupee Dive (All Versions, Difficult)

1. Use a rupee value that still triggers its textbox on the current file (typically greater than 1).
2. Manipulate the rupee to the edge of a platform (often with boomerang/object interactions).
3. Collect it with a jump attack or spin attack so Link is falling off the ledge as the rupee textbox triggers.

### Rupee Dive with Jump Strike

Use the rupee setup above, then Jump Strike over the rupee so the rupee text trigger is delayed until landing. This is more niche because Jump Strike is a late hidden skill.

## Bottle Diving

This is a controllable variant of Cutscene Diving using a bottle.
