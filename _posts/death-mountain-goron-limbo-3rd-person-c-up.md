## Summary

To do this, put your iron boots on, and when you hear a Goron rolling at you, go into first-erson. Then once the Goron reaches you, you'll still be it first-person, but in third-person.

This setup can produce a limbo-like camera state where C-Up style control behavior persists while Link is viewed in third person.
