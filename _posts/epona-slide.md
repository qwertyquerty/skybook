## Summary

Epona Slide is a 1-frame dismount timing where Link dismounts while Epona keeps moving forward. Link slides briefly before regaining control, which can be used to clear void gaps and to chain into movement options like [Brake Sliding](/posts/brake-sliding).

## How To

1. Ride Epona and hold `R` so Link crouches.
2. Release `R`.
3. One frame later, press `A` to dismount.
4. If timed correctly, Epona keeps moving while Link dismounts and ground-slides.

## Uses

- Gorge crossing setups, where Epona starts on land and carries through the dismount window over void space.
- Movement chaining into [Brake Sliding](/posts/brake-sliding) after the dismount slide.
- Route-specific application: [Epona Gorge Cross](/posts/epona-gorge-cross).

## Notes

- The input window is very tight (1 frame after releasing `R`), so most consistency comes from rhythm practice.
- The source page indicates Epona will not fall during the dismount animation if the setup starts correctly on land.
