## Summary

Cutscene Boomerang Item Dropping (often called Cutscene Dropping) lets Link start a short cutscene while the boomerang is carrying an object. The boomerang returns to Link, but the carried object drops at its current in-air position instead of completing its normal path.

## How To (Boomerang Method)

1. Throw the boomerang at a carryable object.
2. While the boomerang is returning, trigger a short cutscene state (for example, a bottle-drink animation or other item/cutscene interrupt).
3. If timed correctly, the object drops where it was at cutscene start.

## Common Use

- With [Normal Bombs Underwater](/posts/normal-bombs-underwater), this lets runners sink a normal bomb to specific depths before detonation in setups like Goron Bomb Bag rock access.
