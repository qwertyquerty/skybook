## Summary

Early Deku Toad lets you enter the boss before the normal staircase progression in Lakebed Temple 2F east. The key requirement is a nonzero Early Boss Fights boss flag.

## Requirements

- Nonzero boss flag state from [Back in Time Equipped](/posts/back-in-time-equipped) or compatible [Map Glitch (Warp Method)](/posts/map-glitch-warp-method) routing.
- Entry to the Deku Toad loading zone while that nonzero flag is still active.

## Setup Context

1. Build an Early Boss Fights-compatible state with boss flag value above `0`.
2. Route into Lakebed Temple and reach Deku Toad's loading zone before normal room progression.
3. Enter the loading zone to start Deku Toad early.
