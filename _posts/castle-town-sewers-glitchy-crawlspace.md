## Wolf Link Carrying a Skull Method

Pick up a skull as wolf link, and make sharp 90 degree turns into the tunnel. The skull should get trapped inside, causing Wolf Link to oscillate.

Carry a skull into the tunnel as Wolf Link with sharp turns to trap it and induce oscillation behavior.

## Underwater Iron Boots Method

Repeatedly fail to enter the tunnel when attempting to use iron boots to backtrack in Sewers 2 (when revisiting later in the run).

TODO Cleanup: Be specific, what map version?
