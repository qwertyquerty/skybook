## Summary

Normal Bombs Underwater is a frame-perfect timing trick that lets Link place a standard bomb underwater, bypassing the usual normal-bomb restriction in water.

## Requirements

- A normal bomb available.
- A water entry where Link has at least one eligible input frame before fully entering swim state.

## Method Context

The documented setup is:

1. Fall or jump into water.
2. Pull a normal bomb shortly before water entry.
3. If timed on the valid frame, Link keeps a normal bomb underwater and can place it.

The valid input frame is height-dependent, so some drops have no possible frame for this trick.

## Practical Uses

- Underwater bomb interactions without water bombs.
- Route flexibility when bombs come from [Steal Lent Bomb Bag / Black Rupee](/posts/zoras-river-steal-lent-bomb-bag-black-rupee) or [Infinite Bomb Arrows](/posts/infinite-bomb-arrows).
