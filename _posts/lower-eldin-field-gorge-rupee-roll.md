## Summary

Rupee Roll is the primary fence-crossing method used in [Gorge Skip](/posts/gorge-skip). It uses rupee textbox state, boomerang target placement, and roll momentum to place Link on the outside ledge, then chains into [Long Jump Attack (LJA)](/posts/long-jump-attack-lja) over the gorge.

## Setup Conditions

- The yellow rupee (or backup blue rupee) textbox must not have been seen in the current play session.
- Link needs at least 1.25 hearts so the fence contact does not fail due to low-health behavior.
- This is typically performed during [Gorge Skip](/posts/gorge-skip), but can be practiced standalone.

## Targeting Cue

Final boomerang targeting placement is the main consistency factor for getting the ledge-grab.

## Execution

1. Align at the left fence-side setup spot used in [Gorge Skip](/posts/gorge-skip).
2. Throw boomerang using the documented target line so Link's roll path catches the fence edge correctly.
3. Roll at the fence to force the over-fence movement and grab/land on the outside ledge.
4. Continue with [Long Jump Attack (LJA)](/posts/long-jump-attack-lja) to finish crossing.

## Notes

- If the rupee textbox has already been consumed this session, this method becomes unreliable or unavailable.
- [Epona Slide](/posts/epona-slide) and other Epona routes are alternatives, but Rupee Roll is generally the fastest standard setup for this part of [Gorge Skip](/posts/gorge-skip).
