## Summary

Displacement clipping is a family of clips where Link is pushed partially into collision by an actor (commonly a pot), then a second action (usually item pickup) moves Link fully through the wall.

This is the core technique behind setups like [City in the Sky - Gate Skip via Pot Displacement](/posts/city-in-the-sky-gate-skip-via-pot-displacement) and [Poe Gate Clip via Pot Displacement](/posts/arbiters-grounds-poe-gate-clip-via-pot-displacement).

## Common Variants

### Ceiling-collision variant

Use a carried actor to push into a wall while Link is held down by overhead collision. This stabilizes the angle and can make wall entry easier.

### Clawshot-through variant

After partial displacement, clawshotting a pickup (typically a rupee) can nudge Link through the remaining collision.
