## Summary

Swim with Water Bombs is an underwater item-state glitch. By unequipping Iron Boots during water-bomb pullout, Link can keep moving underwater while holding a water bomb.

The main practical result is Air Replenish: dropping that bomb with `A` refills Link's air meter without surfacing. A fast variant, [Rocket Link](/posts/rocket-link), pops Link to the water surface.

## How To (Air Replenish)

1. Equip Iron Boots and sink to the bottom of a body of water.
2. Pull a water bomb and open the item wheel before Link raises it overhead.
3. Reassign over the Iron Boots button to force boots unequip, then hold movement.
4. Close the item wheel and keep holding direction so Link keeps swimming while holding the bomb.
5. Drop the water bomb with `A` to refill air. Other drop inputs do not produce the same air refill.

## Variant: Rocket Link

- Perform the same setup, but press `A` to drop immediately after pullout.
- Link teleports to the surface of the current body of water.

## Known Use Cases

- Fighting Morpheel without normal underwater routing: [Morpheel without Zora Armor](/posts/morpheel-without-zora-armor).
- Any route segment that wants extra underwater time without surfacing for air.

## Notes

- This is listed as all versions.
- Neutral-stick handling is possible during setup, but the timing window is stricter.
