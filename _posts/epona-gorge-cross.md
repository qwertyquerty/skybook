## Summary

Epona Gorge Cross is an Eldin Gorge crossing route that uses Epona movement after [Back in Time](/posts/back-in-time) setup. It is primarily used as an alternative to [Lower Eldin Field Gorge - Rupee Roll](/posts/lower-eldin-field-gorge-rupee-roll) during [Gorge Skip](/posts/gorge-skip) routing.

## Method Overview

1. Enter gorge setup with BiTE state active (see [Back in Time](/posts/back-in-time) and [Back in Time Save](/posts/back-in-time-save)).
2. Use Epona positioning/movement to clear the gorge-side fence/gap segment.
3. Continue route progression on Kakariko side.

## Notes

- This page tracks the BiTE-dependent Epona crossing variant, not the standard [Epona Slide](/posts/epona-slide) tech page.
- Compared with [Lower Eldin Field Gorge - Rupee Roll](/posts/lower-eldin-field-gorge-rupee-roll), this method is more route-state dependent but can serve as a backup or category-specific option.
