## Summary

Our leading theory is that Habreno likely accidentally did Save Leaking on Wii to start a chain reaction of Actor Corruption (TODO: Cite), resulting in actors disappearing over the course of his run.

## Save File Creation

This video documents setup steps from Wii boot that prepared the save state used for the later glitch run.

## Actors Disappearing

Shows one visible effect in a later run after the earlier Wii glitch trigger sequence.

## Audio Glitches

Likely actor corruption side effects causing audio issues across different locations.

## Full glitch from console boot

A pre-run Wii test appears to include the likely glitch trigger; around 10:56 it may include a Save Leak.
