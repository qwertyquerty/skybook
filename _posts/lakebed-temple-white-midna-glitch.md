This page was migrated from the compendium by an AI agent, and could use human cleanup!

## Summary
Beating Morpheel while Lanayru remains in twilight can break the Zant cutscene and retain White Midna effects.

## Primary Source

## Via Actor Corruption

Corrupt actor state so the Zant cutscene fails to load correctly, producing White Midna-style effects.

## Theoretical White Midna Glitch via Morpheel Final Frame Death

Unconfirmed theory: dying on the same frame Morpheel dies from a bomb may trigger White Midna Glitch behavior.

## Primary Source

This was achieved with hacks, and has not yet been verified in normal gameplay.

## Side Effects

With White Midna glitch active, the 20 Poe souls cannot be turned in, plus some other dialog oddities.

TODO: This section could use expansion. What oddities?
