## Summary
White Midna Glitch is triggered by clearing Lakebed Temple while Lanayru is still in twilight. The post-Lakebed Zant encounter sequence fails, leaving a mixed game state where Midna is injured but still retains warp access.

Discovered by `mzxrules` (Per the source page).

## Core Setup Context

- Commonly paired with [Early Master Sword](/posts/early-master-sword) progression.
- Route into early Lakebed access (often via [Lake Hylia - Early Lakebed Temple](/posts/lake-hylia-early-lakebed-temple-various-methods) and/or [Lake Hylia - Empty Lake Hylia](/posts/lake-hylia-empty-lake-hylia)).
- Clear Lakebed Temple and defeat Morpheel before normal Lanayru-twilight completion order.

## Minimum Setup Path

1. Collect Fishing Rod, complete "fixed" [Early Master Sword](/posts/early-master-sword), and clear Goron Mines for Barnes' Bomb Bag.
2. Empty the bomb bag and catch Water Bombs at Eldin Bridge.
3. In Lanayru Twilight, collect all tears except the last one (after defeating the giant bug).
4. Beat Lakebed Temple before finishing Lanayru Twilight.

## Observed Effects

- Zant encounter sequence starts, then aborts unexpectedly.
- Spirit cutscene logic continues in an inconsistent state.
- Midna's Desperate Hour enemy set can remain active in unusual contexts.
- Dark twilight visual/state artifacts may persist depending on area transitions.

## Important Routing Impact

The key payoff is injured Midna with retained warp access. This can enable early region movement and sequence breaks that are normally blocked before later story beats.

## Side Effects

- 20 Poe soul turn-in is blocked while the state is active.
- Additional dialogue/state oddities may occur depending on map transitions.
