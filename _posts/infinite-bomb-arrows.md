## Summary

By taking Plumm's minigame out of bounds and re-entering Iza state incorrectly, bomb and arrow counters can become effectively infinite.

## Requirements

- Iza 2 availability (you already completed or skipped Iza 1 and can start Iza's second minigame).
- At least 20 rupees to start the minigame attempt.
- Access to Plumm's hawk minigame in Lake Hylia.

## Method Overview

This setup is commonly documented together with Iza 1 Skip. The shared flow is:

1. Start Plumm's minigame in Lake Hylia.
2. Perform a Kargarok out-of-bounds clip.
3. Crash Kargarok while out of bounds, then void and respawn on the OOB ledge.
4. For Infinite Bomb Arrows specifically, jump into the water as wolf and take the Iza retry prompt path.
5. After accepting retry and returning to Iza's hut, warp away; bombs/arrows remain infinite.

## Practical Uses

- Safe ammo routing for heavy bomb-arrow usage.
- Transferring bombs/arrows into a new file with [Back in Time](/posts/back-in-time) flow (tracked separately at [Infinite Bomb Arrows on New File](/posts/infinite-bomb-arrows-on-new-file)).
- Enables early route options that leverage bomb arrows, including scenarios tied to [Forest Temple - Early Monkeys](/posts/forest-temple-early-monkeys).
