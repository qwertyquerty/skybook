## Summary

Quick Climb is a Wolf Link movement technique where specific ledges allow climbing without the full climb animation, preserving speed through transitions.

## How To

1. Approach a valid ledge as Wolf Link with enough forward speed.
2. Angle movement so Link catches the climb in a way that skips the full animation.
3. Continue movement immediately after ledge transition.

## Known Use Cases

- [Kakariko Sanctuary - Early City in the Sky](/posts/kakariko-sanctuary-early-city-in-the-sky), where quick climb movement can contribute to the boss key route.
- [Lakebed Temple - Early Deku Toad](/posts/lakebed-temple-early-deku-toad), where Wolf movement and ledge handling can affect early-boss pacing.

## Notes

- This is location dependent; only certain ledges produce useful quick-climb behavior.
- This tech is tied to route-specific examples rather than a single universal setup.
