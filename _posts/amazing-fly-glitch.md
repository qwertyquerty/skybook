## Summary

Catch fish underwater with iron boots to put fish into a glitched state that can be recaught later, enabling effects like hovering or unusual fishing behavior.

## Room Change Crashes

Catching a fish with duped fishing rods can leave it dangling from the rod, and unloading that fish across a room change can cause a crash.
