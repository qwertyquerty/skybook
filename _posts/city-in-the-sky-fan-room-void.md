## Summary

Somehow, a Clawshot L-Slide (CITATION NEEDED) slightly onto the top of the fan, causing collision with the fan to disappear and allowing Link to void.

A slight upwarp onto fan geometry can drop collision and let Link void from the fan room.

I think this is solved? Probably just a clawshot actor displacement crush. If so, delete this post.
