## Summary

Use [Displacement Clipping](/posts/displacement-clipping) to enter the wall near the small-key room gate, then finish the clip by clawshotting a rupee through the gate collision.

## Setup

1. Stand by the gate-side wall where the displacement setup is done.
2. Position a pot for the displacement push (standard displacement setup).
3. Align Link so the wall push places Link partially into collision.

### Visual Cue

## Execution

1. Perform the displacement push to get partial wall entry.
2. While displaced, clawshot the nearby rupee pickup to force the final clip through.
3. Move into the next room and continue route progression.

## Notes

- The source page notes this setup can save around 3 seconds in City in the Sky.
- [Long Jump Attack (LJA)](/posts/long-jump-attack-lja) and [3rd-person clawshot clip movement](/posts/clawshot-actor-displacement) are related movement options in this area, but this page focuses on the pot-displacement gate method.
