## Summary

Gorge Void is the forced-warp skip used at the start of [Gorge Skip](/posts/gorge-skip). After the twilight messenger fight, there is a one-frame window to jump attack into the gorge before Midna's auto-warp takes over. If successful, Link respawns on Kakariko side and can continue gorge crossing routes without immediately warping to Faron.

## Input Window

Input on the frame where the portal ring reaches the top of its render cycle.

## Execution

1. Trigger the post-messenger cutscene state at Eldin Gorge.
2. As control returns, jump attack into the gorge during the one-frame pre-warp window.
3. If the timing is correct, Link respawns outside Midna's forced warp trigger.
4. Continue with [Lower Eldin Field Gorge - Rupee Roll](/posts/lower-eldin-field-gorge-rupee-roll) or another crossing method.

## Bottle Warp Cancel Variant

A frame-perfect bottle input during warp selection cancels forced warp but enables [Map Glitch Warp Method](/posts/map-glitch-warp-method), so routes commonly pair it with a savewarp before continuing.

## Notes

- This page tracks the "Gorge Void" opener specifically; full route flow is documented on [Gorge Skip](/posts/gorge-skip).
- The setup is highly timing-sensitive, and visual rhythm practice from the cue image is usually required for consistency.
