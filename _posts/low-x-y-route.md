## About

The goal of the low x/y presses route is to demonstrate how many x and y presses are required to beat the game. The main idea of course was to limit both of the buttons because you can equip items on both of those buttons. This limits the item uses and creates a unique route. To further test the limits, the initial route created is looking through the absolute limits of this category, so TAS only glitches and tricks, as well as RNG manipulation will all be accounted for in the following route.

## What is limited

Both the X and Y button are used to equip items and also use those items. Additionally X is also used for the senses as wolf and Y is used for digging as Wolf. Both buttons are only used in this game for their press or release parts so holding the buttons doesn't matter during the run.

## Common things we can use

### Hidden Skills

This run will obtain all the hidden Skills. Everything that provides more damage or hight for certain tricks is really useful in a challenge like this. The TAS can get all of them immediately after Lanayru Twilight with Item Wheel Delay to get obtain them all on the same golden wolf.

### Magic Armor

After beating Lanayru Twilight and saving up a lot of money, the Magic Armor is acessible. It has two different uses. It can be used for long tricks where taking a lot of damage is unavoidable, so its invincibility property can come in handy there. There is also the other property of the heavy modification once you are on 0 Rupees. While there are some differences compared to the Iron Boots in terms of what specifically checks for the Iron Boots and what doesn't, it is no problem for this route and the Iron Boots get completely skipped.

Additionally in the combination with Hidden Skills, this allows for another glitch with Moon Boots. After taking off the Magic Armor when leaving the ground, we can gain additional height which proves to be quite useful for this route.

### Zora Armor

For underwater sections, instead of using Water Bombs to air refill, of course Zora Armor just makes underwater movement much easier and also doesn't take x or y presses. 

### Rupee Slides or Displacement Clips

A lot of walls exist in this game. But if you have a Rupee, then bypassing a wall or a trigger becomes possible. While very long Rupee Slides can be theoretically done, not many people would be willing to TAS or watch it. With Displacement Clips, you can clip through the walls without requiring a very long rupee slide, but not every type of those have been tested. If there is no pot in reach, Displacement Clips with Rupees are still theoretically possible by collecting a Rupee at the same frame when it falls on you for a Displacement Clip, but the Rng is very difficult to achieve.

### Boomerang on X and Y

Usually in a speedrun, you go to Iza to obtain and even duplicate Bomb Bags from her. Additionally when you dupe a Bomb Bag, for some reason, the item in Slot 1 - the Boomerang - is now in all equip slots, so both X and Y. This is very useful because it allows for equipping Boomerang without using X or Y, saving one press. 

Additionally this state of the equips is only temporary. Once you die or reach a save promt, the game will revert back to the equips you had before getting Boomerang on X and Y. This is a way to preserve important equips like the Clawshot for example. So using the Boomerang where it is required and then dying does result in giving the equip of the Clawshot back which saves some X and Y presses.

## The Route

*This route was mainly developed by spicyjuice04. Since this route is not yet perfect for general rupee routing and the description of tricks is not very detailed, for questions reach out to them in Discord either through DM's or the TP Speedrunning Discord.*

- Ordon Gate Clip 
- Back in Time on Ordon Bridge 
- BiT Save over File 1 
- Call Epona 
- Epona Gate Clip to Hyrule Field 
- Epona Seam Clip 
- Ride Epona Out of Bounds to the Gorge and get the Portal and Gorge Void 
- Call Epona again and Clip back into Faron 
- Lantern (do not equip) 
- Faron Cave with Web Clips
- Small Key and open Gate to North Faron (if a displacement clip with a rupee slide is possible has not yet been proven)
- Get small chest and Free Talo (R10)

(The route I am doing does NOT do Faron Escape Rupee Slide and Escort Rupee Slide as they are only theoretical and take too much time. The inconsistency of needing an angle that gives speed on all Polygons you slide through is just so unlikely and timeconsuming that I take the loss of 3 X/Y presses it could theoretically save)

(Overall completing Faron Twilight instead of getting the boomerang first saves 3 X/Y presses, that route would Equip Lantern (1 X/Y), Lantern Puzzle (4 X/Y), Equip Boomerang (1 X/Y), Faron Escape with Boomerang (1 X/Y) (total 7 X/Y)
