## Summary

Gorge Skip gets Link to Kakariko side without restoring the bridge from North Faron. The common route flow is:

1. Perform [Lower Eldin Field Gorge - Warp Into Void](/posts/lower-eldin-field-gorge-warp-into-void) ("Gorge Void") or Bottle Warp Cancel.
2. Cross the left fence (most commonly [Lower Eldin Field Gorge - Rupee Roll](/posts/lower-eldin-field-gorge-rupee-roll)).
3. Use [Long Jump Attack (LJA)](/posts/long-jump-attack-lja) to clear the gorge.

## Gorge Void (Forced Warp Skip)

After the twilight messenger fight, there is a single input frame before Midna forces warp to Faron. Jump attacking into the gorge on that frame respawns Link outside Midna's trigger.

### Input Cue

Input on the frame where the portal ring is at the top of its render cycle.

### Bottle Warp Cancel Variant

A frame-perfect bottle press during warp selection cancels forced warp but enables [Map Glitch Warp Method](/posts/map-glitch-warp-method), so a savewarp is typically required afterward.

## Fence Crossing: Rupee Roll

Rupee Roll is the fastest documented method and is now also tracked at [Lower Eldin Field Gorge - Rupee Roll](/posts/lower-eldin-field-gorge-rupee-roll).

Core cues:

- The yellow (or backup blue) rupee textbox must be unseen in the current play session.
- Link needs at least 1.25 hearts to complete the roll-over behavior.
- Final boomerang targeting placement strongly affects ledge-grab consistency.

## LJA Over The Gorge

Once on the outside ledge, sidehop/position along the fence line and execute the boomerang-timed [Long Jump Attack (LJA)](/posts/long-jump-attack-lja) across the gap.

## Alternative Crossing Methods

- [Epona Slide](/posts/epona-slide) gorge cross
- Epona bomb boost over fence into LJA
- Epona backhop into fence slide into LJA

These are slower or more situational than Rupee Roll in most any% contexts, but useful as backups or route-specific choices.
