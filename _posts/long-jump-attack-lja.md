## Summary

A Long Jump Attack (LJA) is a jump attack that gains extra horizontal speed when Link is locked onto a target that is positioned above Link's current floor height (or over qualifying void). This is used to cross larger gaps, reach out-of-bounds space, and enable sequence breaks.

LJAs are possible with enemies/objects on all versions. The Gale Boomerang-targeted method is GameCube-only in normal play.

## Core Behavior

- Normal jump attack speed is roughly `~36`.
- A successful LJA can raise this to about `~72` depending on target position.
- If the target is lower than Link's current floor height, jump attack speed can be reduced instead.

## Setup

1. Pick a target you can lock onto (enemy, object, or Gale Boomerang pathing target).
2. Stand at your launch point and pre-align camera/facing for where you need to land.
3. Ensure the target is moving or positioned over higher ground/void relative to Link.

## Execution

### Gale Boomerang LJA (GCN)

1. Throw Gale Boomerang over high ground or qualifying void.
2. Pull sword with `B` while preserving lock behavior.
3. Time the jump attack when the boomerang is in the favorable position.
4. Press `A` to release jump attack and carry the boosted speed.

### Enemy LJA (GCN/Wii)

1. Lure and target an enemy near your launch point.
2. Hit the enemy so it pops upward.
3. Jump attack while it is airborne to inherit higher-speed targeting.

## Jump Strike LJA (JSLJA)

Jump Strike LJA behaves similarly but uses jump strike speed values instead of standard jump attack.

- Normal jump strike speed is about `~20`.
- JSLJA can reach roughly `~57`.
- Compared with regular LJA, JSLJA can provide more height and cleaner recoil behavior in some setups.

JSLJA is relevant in specific routing contexts such as [City in the Sky - Small Key Skip](/posts/city-in-the-sky-small-key-skip), and can pair with [Moon Boots](/posts/moon-boots) where extra height is preferred.

## Notes

- Gale Boomerang LJA is practically unavailable on Wii because sword pull breaks the needed lock behavior without hacks.
- Some voids with underlying collision do not provide the expected LJA boost.
- A common route application is [Sword & Shield Skip](/posts/sword-shield-skip), which uses enemy positioning to create an LJA window.
