## Summary

Early Lakebed is a family of setups that enter Lakebed Temple before intended progression. Methods vary by version, equipment, and whether Lake Hylia is in twilight or [Empty Lake Hylia](/posts/lake-hylia-empty-lake-hylia).

## Method Families

### Entry via Empty Lake Hylia

- Direct entry route using [Lake Hylia - Empty Lake Hylia](/posts/lake-hylia-empty-lake-hylia).

### Pillar Clip Without Zora Armor (all versions)

- Requires [Early Master Sword](/posts/early-master-sword).
- Modern route clips through the pillar and uses tap swimming timing to barely reach the loading zone.
- Older setupless variants exist but are generally outdated.

### Pillar Clip With Zora Armor (all versions)

- Swim positioning route between the large blue pillar and adjacent green pillar.
- Use upward swim acceleration and pass through collision into the loading zone.
- Cue points: line up the minimap arrow northwest, remove Iron Boots, then hold target and mash swim upward.

### Rupee Dive (twilight-only, outdated)

- Uses rupee text timing and a pre-input sword action to trigger dive behavior.
- Historically useful, but mostly replaced by stronger setups.

### Midna Dive Variants (Wii-focused)

- Platform Midna Dive in twilight (version-limited).
- Isle of Riches Midna Dive with Zora Armor.
- [Bug Boss Midna Dive - Early Lakebed Temple](/posts/bug-boss-midna-dive-early-lakebed-temple) for specific bug-despawn timing.

### Ooccoo Dive

- Uses Ooccoo near plank edges to dive under floor collision.

## Notes

- Several methods are version-restricted (notably Wii NA 1.2 / Korean exclusions for some Midna Dive setups).
- Method choice is route-dependent and often favors consistency over theoretical fastest clip.
