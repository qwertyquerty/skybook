## Summary

Gate Clip (Ordon Gate Clip) pushes Link through the closed Ordon gate collision for early access to Faron-side progression and related route breaks, including [Gorge Skip](/posts/gorge-skip).

Two main methods are used: a rock wedge setup (all versions) and an Epona backflip setup (GCN-focused).

## Rock Wedge Technique (All Versions)

1. Pick up a path rock near the Eldin Springs/Faron Province gate approach.
2. Place it by one gate door near the middle posts.
3. Stand at the opposite door at roughly a 45-degree angle and sidehop between gate and rock to get pushed into the gap.
4. Roll into the gate center and use minimap angle control so Link bonks out to the target side.

## Epona Backflip Technique (GCN)

1. Ride [Epona Slide](/posts/epona-slide) setup to the gate.
2. Back Epona into the center of one gate door.
3. Rear Epona, then input `R + A` to backflip into gate collision.
4. Use the same center-bonk roll method to eject to the desired side.

## Consistency Cues

- The clip entry usually comes from the sidehop/backflip forcing Link into the narrow center opening.
- Exit direction is controlled by roll angle relative to gate center; shallow diagonal lines are most common.
- If Link bonks back to start side, reset quickly and repeat without moving the rock far from center.
