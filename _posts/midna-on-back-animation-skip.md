## Summary

This is a Faron Twilight 1-framer: after a dig resolves and before Midna's landing animation starts, dash on the single available frame to skip the landing animation.

## How to Perform

1. Complete any required dig action in Faron Twilight.
2. As soon as control returns, input dash immediately.
3. If timed correctly, Midna's landing animation is skipped and movement resumes sooner.
