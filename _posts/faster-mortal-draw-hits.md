## Summary

The source page documents two faster Mortal Draw variants. One improves hit timing but has slower recovery (`fast spin`), and one is faster on both hit and recovery (`no spin`) when performed out of a roll.

## Frame Data

| Variation | Frames to hit | Frames to regain control |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Normal    | 13            | 29                       |
| Fast spin | 9             | 34                       |
| No spin   | 7             | 20                       |

Exact frame counts can vary slightly with enemy placement.

## Fast Spin Input

1. Start Mortal Draw from the sheathed stance.
2. Either hold slightly forward before `A`, or press forward and `A` together.
3. Link performs a faster spin draw that hits earlier and covers a wider swing.

## No Spin Input

1. Roll.
2. Press `A` to Mortal Draw on one of the first 4 possible post-roll frames.
3. The spin animation is skipped, giving the fastest documented hit and recovery timing.
